          The Hamster Heroes metadata are stored on IPFS, a permanent
          decentralised data storage. Each hamster is generated from over 70
          possible traits over 6 layers, some rarer than the others. To pay
          homage to the most popular game on Fantom, Rarity Game, 11 Hamster
          Heroes have taken on their classes as Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid,
          Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer to rally the Hamster
          Army. They are differentiated by wearing a Class Hat and a Class
          Weapon and have their heads bobbing. This is because theyâ€™re cute and
          they are only allowed to do cute stuff, you know? Their goal is to
          start the Bobbing Hamster Heads Revolution.
